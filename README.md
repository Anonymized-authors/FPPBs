# Fair Privacy-Preserving Blueprints from Functional Commitments
Source code of our instantiations of fair privacy-preserving blueprint (FPPB.py), privacy-preserving functional encryption (PPFE.py), and privacy-preserving functional commitment (PPFC.py) for inner-product functionality, and the compared blind functional encryption (BFE.py), including the involved non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems (Pi.py and PiBFE.py). Note that BFE (ICICS'2020) only considers the decryption key derivation process.

* Install the Python 3.6+ environment and PyCharm;
* Install the library “Charm-crypto 0.5” (see [GitHub](https://github.com/JHUISI/charm));
* Import the project into PyCharm.
* Run the Python file through the command "python test_benchmark_****.py".
